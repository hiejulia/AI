# Adapt IoT for Smart cities 
- A network of smart things (sensors, cameras, actuators, and so on) for gathering data
- Field (cloud) gateways that can gather the data from low power IoT devices, store it, and forward it securely to the cloud
- Streaming data processor for aggregating numerous data streams and distributing them to a data lake and control applications
- A data lake for storing all the raw data, even the ones that seem of no value yet
- A data warehouse that can clean and structure the collected data
- Tools for analyzing and visualizing the data collected by sensors
- AI algorithms and techniques for automating city services based on long-term data analysis and finding ways to improve the performance of control applications
- Control applications for sending commands to the IoT actuators
- User applications for connecting smart things and citizens

- Learn about cities across the globe implementing smart solutions.
- Understand the challenges in building smart cities
