# AI in IoT 

- Wearables
- monitor heart using ML
- smart home 

- SuperSecure
    - CCTV 
    - AI powered smart surveillance solution 


- smart lighting 
    - If This Then That (IFTTT)
    - train AI to classify human activities from videos 
    - use the trained AI to detected action of the person in the room

## Continuous glucose monitoring

- Hypoglycemia prediction using CGM data
- predictor based on research paper Glucose Concentration can be predicted ahead in time from Continuous glucose monitor sensor time series 
- CGM time serires glucose data 
    - model1: polynomial 
        - scikit linear regressor 
        
    - model2: first order autoregressive model 




## Human activity recognition
- camera to record human activity and classify using DL 
- wearable sensor whose data is recorded and use to predict activity



- HAR from videos
    - CNN 
    - actions : walking, jogging, running, boxing, hand waving, hand clapping 
    - image convert to 2D grayscale 
    - reduce number of frame 
    - reduce spatial resolution of individual frame 
    - model -> 3D convolutional layers

- HAR using wearable sensors
    - Applewatch 
        - ios OS 
    - smartphone sensor 
    - data ; HAR using random forest
    - dataset : Human activity recognition using smartphone on ANN
        - tria
