## Image detection 

- feature detection and optical flow, dimensionality reduction
- ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)
- convolutional neural networks (CNN) and max pooling, added rectified linear units (ReLUs) and GPU processing for significant speedups, and built a neural network composed of several "layers." - 97% accuracy
- feature extraction


## Neural network & deep learning 
- network topology - weights
- activation function





## tech stack 
- Keras, Tensorflow 
- YOLO
