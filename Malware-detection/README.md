# malware detection with deep learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- Feedforward Networks (FFN)



## from images to malware
- send executable code of malware in form of image to be fed to CNN 


## dataset 
- malware : binary sequence of zeros and 1 -> gray scale image 
- similarities in terms of layouts and textures existing in the images that represent them
- malware codes : malimg.npz 

## how to run 
- Usage: main.py [-h] -m MODEL -d DATASET -n NUM_EPOCHS -c PENALTY_PARAMETER -k CHECKPOINT_PATH -l LOG_PATH -r RESULT_PATH
- use the CNN-SVM model, set the -model parameter to 1, as in the following
    - main.py –model 1 –dataset ./dataset/malimg.npz –num_epochs 100 –penalty_parameter 10 -c ./checkpoint/ -l ./logs/ -r ./results/
