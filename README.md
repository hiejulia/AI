## Deep learning 
### NLP & sentimental analysis with RNTN 
- Background on natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis
- Core NLP: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/
    - NLP processing such as sentence detection
    - word detection
    - part-of-speech tagging, named-entity recognition (finding names of people, places, dates, and so on), and sentiment analysis. 
    - Several NLP features, such as sentiment analysis, depend on prior processing including sentence detection, word detection, and part-of-speech tagging.
    - 85.4% accuracy for detecting positive/negative sentiment of sentences.
- Recursive neural tensor networks (RNTN) 
- twitter & reddit api 
- Data aggregation 
- Sentiment detector
    - libraries, hbc-core, JRAW, and Crux.

### CoreNLP processing pipeline 
- tokenization
- dependency tree
- annotations
-  part-of-speech tags
