## fingerprint 
- distinctive feature 
    - shinglings 
    - locality sensitive hashing LSH 


## Dimensionality reduction with principal component analysis (PCA)
- Linear correlation coefficient 

## Eigenfaces

## MPL classifier


## Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues


## Variance, covariance, and the covariance matrix



## hardware 
- embedded camera


## data 
- data reliability 
- real time facial recognition 
- labeled faces in the wild (LFW) archive (Gary B. Huang, Manu Ramesh, Tamara Berg, and Erik Learned-Millerâ€”Labeled Faces in the Wild: A Database for Studying Face Recognition in Unconstrained Environments, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Technical Report 07-49, October, 2007), which is available for download at http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw-funneled.tgz.
